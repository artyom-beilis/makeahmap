Limitations:
------------
1. The areas below latitude S60 are not supported. (Not much WW2 action thou)
   due to lack of the relevant data from GlobCover database

2. There is known problem of slight misalignment of the rivers and shores.
   You can try to use river_north_shift/river_east_shift options to
   amge global corrections and it is good idea to check the rivers
   ends before you start working on terrain objects.
