# Specify the width of the river in pixels
# ----------------------------------------
#
# Resets all river width to this value. Note: should appear before river_width[N]!
#
# river_width=3
#
# Set width for specific river level where level is defined between [].
#
# river_width[1]=5


# Minimal level of rivers to draw.
# --------------------------------
#
# Samller the value less rivers are rendered, i.e. only major shown, higherer the value
# more rivers rivers rendered. By default (-1), all rivers are rendered. Setting this value to 0,
# woudl prevent river rendeting totally
#
river_level=5
#

# River alignment fix.
# --------------------
#
# The rivers and shores in GSHHS are not fully consistent. The option below allows to adjust the river
# location to bring them to alignment. The actuall values depend on the area. So they should be set
# with simple trial and error
#
# Shift all rivers by X miles to North, (or South for negative values)
#
# river_north_shift=1.0
#
#
# Shift all rivers by X miles to East, (or West for negative values)
#
# river_east_shift=0.0


# Disable or enable slope correction
# -----------------------------------
# The TE allows at most 120 feet changes per 1 mile of a terrain that contains water
# That means that the terrain shape should be corrected along rivers and lakes.
#
# When turned on, it ensures that lakes have same water altitude over their shape (i.e. no slopes withing a lake)
# also it ensures that there is no more than 120 feet per mile altitude drop on edges containing water (i.e. rivers)
# 
# default is yes, allowed values are yes & no
#
# fix_river_slopes=yes
#

# 
# Elmination of rivers causing significant terrain altitude changes
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# If a river creates an altitude change of above river_correction_limit, the river would not
# be rendered. By default, no such limit is enforced. Note, if fix_river_slopes set to no
# this option is disable as well - as no correction is performed
#
river_correction_limit=500
#
#
# Elimination policy
# ------------------
#
# Remove entire river if it causes problem or remove a part of a river
# Allowed values full or partial. Default partial
#
# river_removal_policy=full


# Water Colors Configuration (waterc.bmp)
# ---------------------------------------
#
# Water color for one of the 4 types: lake, river, land and sea
# Note: land color changed nothing in terms of the terrain but makes
# it easier to edit waterc.bmp
# Default is 0
#
# water_color[sea]=0
water_color[lake]=64
water_color[river]=192
# water_color[land]=255
#

# Water depth slope
# -----------------
#
# Allow water depth gradual change from the shore, distance in miles from the shore when the 
# water has full - deep ocean depth. Note high values above 1.0 miles may cause significant
# increase in wated generation times - use with care.
#
# depth_range with index sea, lake or river, note. It is also good idea to set apropriate ground_type.
#
# depth_range[sea]=0.5
# depth_range[lake]=0.5
# depth_range[river]=0.2
#
#
# Advanced Water Generation Opitons
# ---------------------------------
#
# The type of tile given in gndtype.bmp when there are both water and land
# in the same area, or water depth is not full (i.e. waterd is not 9)
# such that ground tiles wntt000XXX.bmp are visible throgh the water.
#
# Default is 0 - water, you may want to set it to 170 - beach, or other types
# according to the tiles you want to use 
#
# ground_type[river]=170
# ground_type[sea]=170
# ground_type[lake]=170
