My plans to add...

1. Add support of water depth for lakes and seas - such that the depth increase according to the distance from a shore.
2. Automatic fixing elevation/water problem were possible
3. Automatic clipboard map generation with colors and shading.
4. Support of map generation that passes E180/W180 line - currently it does not support it (Does it needed?)
5. Automatic data download, unzip/zip etc.
