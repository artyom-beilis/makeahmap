YYYY-MM-DD: Version 0.5

Bug fixes:

- Fixed river rendering to have proper width for rivers at NW/SW directions
- Fixed river width meaning now it really river width in pixels not 1+2*w
- Fixed support of spaces in path names

New features:

- Added support of custom gndtype for the areas were water and land are mixed
- Added support of water depth variation near shores
- Added support of river width per river level
- Added more fine grained river removal such as a part of river is removed rather than entire one

2013-10-24:  Version 0.4

Bug fixes:

- Fixed incorrect file generation for terrains of size < 512
- Fixed trees appearing over the water

New features:

- Added an option to shift river position globally in attempt to correct 
  alignment issues


2013-10-23:  Version 0.3

Bug fixes:

- Fixed crash when rendering terrain at far east globe locations

New features:

- Added support of automatic terrain altitude corrections such that:

  (a) The water slopes of rivers are below 120 feet per mile
  (b) Lake water has same altitude all over the lake
  (c) Altitude corrections near sea shores are much more accurate 
  
- Added support of automatic rivers removal if they create too big
  terrain changes - create to deep canyons.
  
  By setting parameter river_correction_limit you can remove such rivers.
  
  The program would run two passes - first to detect the rivers during
  altitude correction and second actual correction after removing problematic
  rivers.

2013-10-22:  Version 0.2

Bug fixes:

- Fixed bug of not generating shores in Western Hemisphere
- Fixed bug of the scale parameter not being used.
- Fixed elevations near sea-shores - set to 0 to reduce water slope problems
- Removed rivers near edges of terrain - reduce amount of slope issues
- All rivers now have beaches

New features:

- Added support of SRTM30/GTOPO30 elevaion database (that is much smaller but yet accurate enough for most purposes)
- Added selection of river levels to draw
- Added suppport of gz compression of GSHHS and DEM files such that DEM/hgt and gshhs files can be gz-compressed
- Added custom globcover to AH tiles support (groundmapping.csv)
- Initial clipboardmap generation (not really useful)


2013-10-19:  Version 0.1

- Added support of GSHHS database for shores generation
- It is possible to use central point latitude/logitude + scale to select a region

2013-10-16: Version 0.0

- Initial alpha release
