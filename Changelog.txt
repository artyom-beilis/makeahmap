2017-01-25: Version 1.9

- Added 3 types of ground mapping european, pacific and mediterranean optimized different tile sets
  they can be selected using tile_set option in config.ini
- Implemented automatic updates checks and updater software.
- Fixed bug #4: Now really the smoothing is much more accurate and peasing

2017-01-19: Version 1.8

- Fixed bug #1: No support of area around E180/W180 
- Fixed bug #4: Implemented smoothing of the splattypes

2017-01-18: Version 1.7

- Improvements in globcover -> splattype mapping, switched to simple groundtype.csv format, related to bug #4
- Fixed bug #5 invalid water generation for terrains < 512
- Fixed bug #2 hanging on flat terrain generation


2016-12-30: Version 1.6

- Fixed problem with downloading over HTTPs - swithced to URLDownloadToFile instead of libcurl
- Added support of variable CBM size - default CMB is 2048x2048 for 512 miles map
- Added error for using SRMT3 for lattitude above N60

2016-06-15: Version 1.5beta

- Fixed 660 feet (1 edge of ground) alignmnent issue between water bodies and elevations
- Fixed crash when no altitude modifications are performed
- Fixed generation of raw file for maps smaller than 512x512 miles
- Improved debug output to color elevations map

2016-06-15: Version 1.4alpha

- Small improvements in CPU solver
- Improved config ini and defaults

2016-06-13: Version 1.3alpha

- Modified water generation 
- Rivers, clipboard map and ground types are supported
- Support of OpenCL for calculations of rivers

2016-05-07: Version 1.2alpha

- Fixed water slope handling
- Fixed water channels between land areas
- Now temp directory is cleaned on startup so in case of download fails program can just run again
- Added options:
   lake_alt_limit - maximal allowed lake altitude - so it would be removed rather then brought to sea level
   lake_or_island_min_size - minimal size of lake or island if it is smaller than this it is not rendered
   water_to_land_slope - the slope the altitude rises from water


2016-05-05: Version 1.1alpha

Initial very basic support of AH3 - only clipboard map and elevations are generated
all lakes put to alt=0 no reivers no ground cover
